Installing and Running
----------------------

To run Tarpon, execute it directly for now:

    $ cd tarpon
    $ python tarpon.py

In order to install Tarpon, execute the following autotools commands:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Uninstall Tarpon using ``make uninstall`` or install Tarpon locally
(rather than system-wide) by executing ``./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local``
before executing ``make``. A distributable package can be built using ``make dist``.

FAQ
---

1. Why did you create your UI in code instead of ``Gtk.Builder``?

Moving to ``Gtk.Builder`` and XML files is a future goal. Originally, I could not figure out how to create a ``Gtk.HeaderBar`` and have it set as the titlebar of a ``Gtk.Window`` automatically using ``Gtk.Builder``.
